### Errors I encountered 

Line 548, 511, and 502 has an error "Error in check_breaks_labels(breaks, labels) : object 'percent' not found". All the packages seem to be loaded in fine so maybe one you are using is missing? I quickly Googled the error and I think you might need to put quotations around percent like (labels = "percent"). When I did that however, I got a different error about object 'variable' not being found, so this might need some more looking into. 

I also got a warning about NAs being introduced when producing the individual chromosome files. I know I got the same warning when I used the as.numeric function. 

Overall, I think your graphs look really good and it all seems very well organized and explained step-by-step in the script.
