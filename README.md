# BCB546_R_Project
This directory contains the following information: 

Files
  1. 10 txt files for increasing SNP positions in maize with missing values as "?"
  2. 10 txt files for increasing SNP positions in teosinte with missing values as "?"
  3. 10 txt files for decreasing SNP positions in maize with missing values as "-"
  4. 10 txt files for decreasing SNP positions in teosinte with missing values as "-"
  5. Rmd and html review from Lizer.
  6. Rmd and html review from McMurchie.
  7. Version 1 of the rmd file for the project that my reviewers used to review my work.
  8. Final version of the rmd file that incorporates some suggestions from my reviewers and fixes a few issues.
  9. Final version of the html file that incorporates some suggestions from my reviewers and fixes a few issues - it's quite large and doesn't look like any html files I've uploaded previously. For grading, I suggest viewing the rmd file and running all chunks at once, it takes less than 3 minutes to run all chunks :)
  10. gitignore

Plots
  1. A genotype calls for group plot
  2. A genotype calls for SampleID plot
  3. A maize chromosome distribution plot
  4. A maize genome distribution plot
  5. A teosinte chromosome distribution plot
  6. A teosinte genomme distribution plot
  7. A genotype calls for a potential gwas plot
  8. A species chromosome distribution plot (in the plots directory only)

Directories
1. Maize - contains the txt files (decreasing and increasing) for maize and easier to locate for grading the project
3. Teosinte - contains the txt files (decreasing and increasing) for teosinte and easier to locate for grading the project
4. Plots - all of the maize/teosinte plots and are easier to locate for grading the project


***Directories were added to the project after reviews***
